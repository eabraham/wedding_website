      <h2>Ceremony</h2>
    </p>
    <h3>Location and Time:</h3>
    <p>Battery Gardens - Saturday May 28, 2016 at 5:30 pm</p>
    <h3>Attire:</h3>
    <p> Formal dress from either culture is appreciated. Battery Gardens’ outdoor patio can be susceptible to winds. A coat check will be provided. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Sanjib Mukherji, a friend of Asmita’s family for over 22 years, will officiate a traditional Vedic ceremony fused with American elements on the outdoor patio next to Battery Gardens. Similar to American culture, the wedding revolves around the tradition that the bride’s family is giving the bride away in marriage to the groom and that he is supposed to provide for her in the next phase of their life. Some parts of the ceremony will be spoken in Sanskrit to legitimize the union. The ceremony is anticipated to last an hour and will be moved indoors in case of inclement weather.
